           <p>My name is Andrew Aira, and I am a senoir student in Belen Jesuit Prepatory School. For the past seven years, I have been studying at Belen doing countless assignments and activities so I can be my best self. One of my favorite inetrests is in engineering which I hope to study in the future. Since I was little, I was always curious about how machines worked and how they were made. I am also fascinated with buildings things with myself using legos to construct massive structures. I am interetsed in designing how buidlings look too, with inspiartion from multiple architecture and art styles. To me, engineering and even architecture are very prestigious dating back to ancinet times such as in Rome nd Greece. One day, I hope I will create a buidling that is efficent, groundbreaking, and beautiful.</p>
            <p> In addition to engineering and school, I have other inetrests or hobbies. One big thing I do is long distance running with myself being apart of the Belen Cross Country team and Track team. In Cross Country, we run a 5 kilometer race in the fastest time as we can as in Track we mainly focus on shorter distances such as the mile. My team trains almost everday for months to get into our best shape, even going onto a trip for a month in alttidue to get better. Other than runnning, I am also intereted in other sports too such as baseball. Ever since I was five years old, I have been following and playing this sport for fun. I love the stories, the atmospere, and even my home town team, the Miami Marlins. Another favorite subject of mine is learning about the history of the world. It is very inetresting to me how things became how they are today and many lessons can be learned from the past. </p>
